Simple Web-Link-Tracker is a simple script that saves URLs submitted via a bookmarklet. The saved links are stored in a JSON file. A session ID is used to avoid IP tracking. There are also some security measures to prevent unwanted access and blacklisting. Considering the fact that no database is used, the performance is only acceptable for a small number of URLs. However, performance may decrease for a large number of links, since the entire JSON array must be loaded and stored for each read or write. However, this is perfectly adequate for personal use.

# gpcleaner [Python] [&#8594;](gpcleaner)
A small Python script that cleans a password list generated by Magnet GrayKey based on user input. The script reads a text file (passwords.txt) and writes filtered values to an output file. Filtering is based on a prefix (item value), a minimum password length (default 4) and a maximum password length (default 64). After cleaning up the prefix, the system checks whether a line begins with {" or [". These lines are also not included in the output file. Duplicate entries are also filtered. These filter properties are used to create a good list of possible passwords.

# pinkungfu [Python] [&#8594;](pinkungfu)

# plotlyimex [Python] [&#8594;](plotlyimex)
